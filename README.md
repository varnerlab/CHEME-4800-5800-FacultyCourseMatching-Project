# CHEME 4/5800 Faculty Matching Project
Template repository for the 4/5800 Faculty-Course matching project.

## Description
One of my jobs as the Department's Associate Director is to match faculty to classes, i.e., to hand out teaching assignments.  Design and implement a program that matches people to teaching positions. Each applicant has a subset of courses they are interested in and a cost required to teach each course. However, faculty can only be appointed to a limited number of classes per semester. This problem might be posed as a minimum-cost flow problem that can be solved using linear programming. You'll need to formulate a model for the edge costs and think about how to handle multiple assignments and disruptions such as sabbatical leave. How does your system predict the Fall 2023 and Spring 2024 assignments, and what does the dual problem tell us about the assignments?
